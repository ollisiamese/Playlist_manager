Playlist_manager
================

Playlist Manager is an app that uses Spotify API to find songs and add them to playlists. 

User can create up to 10 playlists and add up to 100 tracks to each playlist. Each playlist generates a "Spotify button" that plays all the tracks in it.
 Within a playlist, the songs can be sorted by dragging-and-dropping, and the Spotify button will automatically update itself. Each track can also be
dragged and dropped to the trashcan, in order to be deleted from the playlist. 
Total number of the songs and total playlist duration are shown at the bottom of each playlist. 
User can rename a playlist by clicking on its name. 
Playlists are stored in the browser's local storage. 

Within Search Results, user can sort the tracks by clicking on the appropriate header (e.g. "track name", "duration" , etc.).
A track is added to a selected playlist from the Search Results' dropdown menu. 
Search field has autocomplete feature. 

App was made using jQuery, jQuery UI, Knockout js, and Require js.
